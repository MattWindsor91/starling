## Starling

**Starling** is a project to build tools and logics for automated verification of sequentially consistent, low-level concurrent programs.

Work on Starling has been supported, from 2014 to 2018, by an EPSRC Doctoral Training Grant (Matt Windsor).

### People

The following people have worked on Starling:

- [Matt Windsor](https://github.com/MattWindsor91), as part of an upcoming PhD thesis
- [Mike Dodds](https://github.com/septract)
- [Matt Parkinson](https://github.com/mjp41)
- [Ben Simner](https://github.com/bensimner)

### The tool

As part of the Starling project, we have built a tool that takes proof outlines built using a C-style programming language, and verifies the assertions inside them not only for local correctness, but non-interference against parallel invocations of other parts of the program.  Starling can target different backend solvers to tackle different domains: for example, it can use heap reachability solvers to prove properties of shared-heap programs.

The tool is free and open source software, and exists in the following places:

- [Main repository](https://github.com/septract/starling-tool)
- [Matt's development fork](https://github.com/MattWindsor91/starling-tool): tends to have more features than the main repository, but may also be less stable.
